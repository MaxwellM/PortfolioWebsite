        label In my graduate level Advanced Unity Programming course I choose to do a 2D game. I did two projects that semester and this was my first one. Titled Lost in Space, this was a remake of Salvare that I did two years prior. This game was built in Unity(V4.6), images were created in Photoshop, and the music was provided by the Russian Red Army Choir. This showcases Unity's 2D assets through a 2D physics simulation where the player must orbit around planets by using a limited amount of fuel to nudge the probe.

        label In my graduate level Advanced Unity Programming course I choose to do a 2D game. I did two projects this semester and this was my second one. This game was built in Unity(V4.6) and the images were created in Photoshop. This title demos Unity's Rigidbody 2D physics where two AI battle. The game showcases independent limb-to-limb movement instead of the traditional character controller approach. The logic the AI follows is built from three simple rules. If the enemy has a distance larger more than 25, move closer. If the enemy has a distance less than 12, move away. Upon being hit, the character will randomly choose between three attack styles, clockwise, counter clockwise, and random. Also there is a small random chance of jumping too, how fun?

            label Language: C# in Unity
        label Eggcite Bike was created in Unity(V4.6). Every character and bicycle is powered by the use of Rigidbody2D, WheelJoint2D, HingeJoint2D, DistanceJoint2D, and SpringJoint2D components. The bicycles are powered through the WheelJoint2D components that rotate the wheel itself to create movement based upon user input. The goal is to reach the end of the level without crashing. Since you had no choice but to be an egg if you collide with anything you will break. You can rotate the bicycle by pressing the Q/E keys to help maintain balance.

        label Introductory Unity programming course where my final project for the class was to create a game. I choose to produce a 3D action game that featured a realistic medieval environment. The game featured a one square mile realistic environment, night-day system, enemy AI, and rag-doll physics. The game makes use of multiple assets such as: UFPS (Player/AI mechanics), UniStorm (weather), Medieval World Creation Kit (buildings), and the sound effects from Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.

            label Platform: Windows
            label Language: Python in PyGame SDL
        label Group project that consisted of creating a Python game using the PyGame SDL. Unfortunately this group project turned into a solo project with the entire application was designed/built by myself. The game is titled Salvare (Latin for savior) and is a 2D Newtonian Physics based orbit simulator. The objective of the game is to launch a probe from Earth and using a limited amount of fuel nudging it so that it will orbit other planets. The artwork was created using public domain images of construction paper and manipulated in Adobe Photoshop. This won second place at the 2012 UMaine Gaming Expo.
        label Three main features:
        label Alpha Blending: This was accomplished by creating two separate images, a planet and it's ozone layer. The ozone layer was created as a PNG which supports Alpha. In PyGame, the ozone layer was placed behind the planet with Alpha enabled.
        label Animation: Animation was achieved in the main menu by having the probe that was set as it's own PyGame Surface to follow a circular motion. This allowed the probe to move fluidly producing smooth animation.
        label Performance Optimization: All objects that moved were instantiated on their own PyGame Surface and added to an Array which was then called upon at the end of the main while loop. This provided a way to have a single draw call and only redraw what was necessary.

            label Language: Java, Java Swing
        label In my object-oriented programming course I created a simulation with 'turtles' that were set on a random path. Upon a turtle and turtle collision they would become sick, turn a darker color, and slow down for a certain length of time. If a turtle collided while being sick, each subsequent collision would increase the duration of it's sickness also changing it's color and speed. There was also a GUI window that displayed the current turtle's direction and color. The simulation also included a counter for the infected turtles and a reset/pause feature.

        label NCBrowse 2.0 is a Java based NetCDF visualizer that was initially developed by Donald W. Denbo employed by theNOAA/PMEL/EPIC group. I took this application and added further functionality such as a separate panel to display a ncDump, allowing up to eight variables be displayed even across all screens, and allowing simultaneous (multithreaded) videos. This project was intended to provide Phillip M. Dicken's Supercomputing Lab at the University of Maine a useful application to display NetCDF files.

            li Closed Ticket Clients
            li Closed Ticket Types
            li Closed Tickets Quarter Over Quarter
            li All Tickets Closed By Category
            li Service Request Closed Tickets By Category
            li Incident Closed Tickets By Category
        label Also created a customized filter slicer that allows you to filter by year, month, and day.
