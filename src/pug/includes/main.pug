                    a.md-body-1 Interests include web development, cooking, and Star Wars. I have experience as a Product Owner, Full-Stack Engineer, and IT Manager. Primarily my experience has derived from working for the Air Force building emergent software for the F-35 and from a private company that builds compact radars for commercial and military use. Also worked as an IT consultant for the University of Maine's Psychology Department and on an IT Help Desk at a large construction company. For more info, check out my projects on GitHub.
